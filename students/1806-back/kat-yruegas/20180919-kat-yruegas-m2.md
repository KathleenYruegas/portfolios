# Kat Yruegas - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In this module, my goal was to learn as much as possible, but also to learn deeply and with a thorough understanding of the content. I wanted to gain a solid foundation of building web apps in Rails, how to utilize activerecord and SQL to do database queries, and how to create user experiences that are intuitive. I also wanted to gain more insight in working with teams and more pairs, utilizing strong teamwork and learning how to use github more efficiently.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Individual projects allowed me to touch every aspect of building an app in Rails, from setup, to models, controllers, and views, from activerecord queries, and styling. I learned how to utilize a number of resources to complete these projects, including mentors, peers, Ruby and Rails documentation, google searches, and a lot and lot of reading and research. 

#### (Kid Event Organizer)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/KathleenYruegas/kid_event_organizer)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

The motivation behind the Kid Event Organizer is to help co-parents and caregivers keep kids' events organized so everyone is on the same page as far as what kid needs to be where and when.  

I built this app from scratch and added authentication and authorization so there can be different types of users (users and visitors). I utlized activerecord relationships between kids, events, and users to tie together events with kids and which users could see what data. 

This project was not evaluated; however, I did display it at the Turing Code Fair and received great feedback regarding what I had built and what features I could add to improve the app.


#### (Blog Post - Routes in Rails)

* [Medium URL](https://medium.com/@kathleenyruegas/routes-in-rails-914943816509)

This is a blog I wrote at the end of Mod 2 about Rails Route Helpers. My intended audience was a student coming into Mod 2, just learning about Rails and how the route helpers work, what they look like, and why they are beneficial.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

In my group projects, I worked with either one or two other people. The process of working in a group helped me strengthen my teamwork and communication skills as well as my Github use. Learning how to pull a teammates branch to help them with an issue before they did a Pull Request was a big one I learned and have utlized it often since. We also had to deploy projects to Heroku which was a great learning experience for how to move from development into production.

#### (Little Shop)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JLing88/little-shop-redux)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/little-shop-redux)

This assignment was to build a small shop using Sinatra. I worked in a group with two other people on this project. This was the first project of Mod 2 and since we were using Sinatra, we were able to really learn about how HTTP requests come in, how the MVC works, and how to structure an app. We built the controller in this project as well as all the models and views. In terms of teamwork, I helped keep my team motivated and kept everyone moving forward. I made sure to ask lots of questions about the code my teammates were writing or had written, and checked in with them to ensure the code I had written was clear. We worked together for most of the project and had a great feedback loop for talking about our code and ensuring everyone was learning about all parts of the project. 

Generally our comments at evaluation were positive. Some things we needed to work on would be to clean up our activerecord calls and try to reduce the amount of calls being made to the database. We had great collaboration and teamwork and all features were functioning and completed. We utilized our debugging tools to learn more about the code and fix any errors that popped up.

1. Feature Completeness: 
Meets Expectations: All features defined in the assignment are correctly implemented
1. Views
Meets Expectations: Views make use of layout(s)
1. Controller
Meets Expectations: Controller is generally well organized with three or fewer methods needing refactoring
1. Models
Meets Expectations: Models show an effort to push logic down the stack, but need more internal refactoring
1. ActiveRecord
Meets Expectations: ActiveRecord is utilized wherever it can be. There is no Ruby where there should be ActiveRecord
1. Testing
Meets Expectations: Project has a running test suite that tests at multiple levels
1. Usability
Meets Expectations: Project is usable, but needs more polish or navigation before it'd be customer-ready
1. Workflow
Meets Expectations: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.
