# Kat Yruegas - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In this module, my goal was to learn as much as possible, but also to learn deeply and with a thorough understanding of the content. I wanted to gain a solid foundation of building web apps in Rails, how to utilize activerecord and SQL to do database queries, and how to create user experiences that are intuitive. I also wanted to gain more insight in working with teams and more pairs, utilizing strong teamwork and learning how to use github more efficiently.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Individual projects allowed me to touch every aspect of building an app in Rails, from setup, to models, controllers, and views, from activerecord queries, and styling. I learned how to utilize a number of resources to complete these projects, including mentors, peers, Ruby and Rails documentation, google searches, and a lot and lot of reading and research. 

#### (Kid Event Organizer)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/KathleenYruegas/kid_event_organizer)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

The motivation behind the Kid Event Organizer is to help co-parents and caregivers keep kids' events organized so everyone is on the same page as far as what kid needs to be where and when.  

I built this app from scratch and added authentication and authorization so there can be different types of users (users and visitors). I utlized activerecord relationships between kids, events, and users to tie together events with kids and which users could see what data. 

This project was not evaluated; however, I did display it at the Turing Code Fair and received great feedback regarding what I had built and what features I could add to improve the app.


#### (Blog Post - Routes in Rails)

* [Medium URL](https://medium.com/@kathleenyruegas/routes-in-rails-914943816509)

This is a blog I wrote at the end of Mod 2 about Rails Route Helpers. My intended audience was a student coming into Mod 2, just learning about Rails and how the route helpers work, what they look like, and why they are beneficial.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

In my group projects, I worked with either one or two other people. The process of working in a group helped me strengthen my teamwork and communication skills as well as my Github use. Learning how to pull a teammates branch to help them with an issue before they did a Pull Request was a big one I learned and have utlized it often since. We also had to deploy projects to Heroku which was a great learning experience for how to move from development into production.

#### (Little Shop)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JLing88/little-shop-redux)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/little-shop-redux)

This assignment was to build a small shop using Sinatra. I worked in a group with two other people on this project. This was the first project of Mod 2 and since we were using Sinatra, we were able to really learn about how HTTP requests come in, how the MVC works, and how to structure an app. We built the controller in this project as well as all the models and views. In terms of teamwork, I helped keep my team motivated and kept everyone moving forward. I made sure to ask lots of questions about the code my teammates were writing or had written, and checked in with them to ensure the code I had written was clear. We worked together for most of the project and had a great feedback loop for talking about our code and ensuring everyone was learning about all parts of the project. 

Generally our comments at evaluation were positive. Some things we needed to work on would be to clean up our activerecord calls and try to reduce the amount of calls being made to the database. We had great collaboration and teamwork and all features were functioning and completed. We utilized our debugging tools to learn more about the code and fix any errors that popped up.

1. Feature Completeness: 
Meets Expectations: All features defined in the assignment are correctly implemented
1. Views
Meets Expectations: Views make use of layout(s)
1. Controller
Meets Expectations: Controller is generally well organized with three or fewer methods needing refactoring
1. Models
Meets Expectations: Models show an effort to push logic down the stack, but need more internal refactoring
1. ActiveRecord
Meets Expectations: ActiveRecord is utilized wherever it can be. There is no Ruby where there should be ActiveRecord
1. Testing
Meets Expectations: Project has a running test suite that tests at multiple levels
1. Usability
Meets Expectations: Project is usable, but needs more polish or navigation before it'd be customer-ready
1. Workflow
Meets Expectations: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

#### (Job Tracker)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/KathleenYruegas/job-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/job-tracker)

This was our first Rails project. I worked with one other person on this and had to utilize strong communication skills in person and via Slack. We utilized Waffle.io for project management and started with organizing all our user stories so we both had a clear idea of what needed to be done. 

This project was to set up a simple Job Tracker as if I was serching for a job, keeping jobs connected to their respective companies, keeping notes on any contacts made within that job, and doing an analytics page that calculated how many jobs I had at a given company or in a certain location or by the level of interest. We utilized multiple controllers in this app, along with increasing the complexity of the activerecord relations between all of the items. There were multiple one to many and many to many relationships in this project. We also utilized more intermediate activerecord queries in order to calculate the analytics for the dashboard page. We used query params to help filter jobs and display content specific to that query.

(Evaluation Comments)
Our evaluation for this project was very positive. All features were complete and functional. Some items to work on included using pure activerecord to query data instead of mixing in Ruby code as well.

(Evaluation Scores)
1. Feature Completeness
Exceeds Expectations: All features are correctly implemented along with two extensions Meets Expectations: All features defined in the assignment are correctly implemented Below Expectations: There are one or two features missing or incorrectly implemented

1. Views
Exceeds Expectations: Views show logical refactoring into layout(s), partials and helpers, with no logic present Meets Expectations: Views make use of layout(s) Below Expectations: Views show weak understanding of erb and 'HTML'. Logic is pervasive in views

1. Controller
Exceeds Expectations: Controller show significant effort to push logic down the stack, utilizing SRP & DRY Meets Expectations: Controller is generally well organized with three or fewer methods needing refactoring Below Expectations: There are four or more controller methods that should have been refactored

1. Models
Exceeds Expectations: Models show excellent organization, refactoring, and appropriate use of ActiveRecord features Meets Expectations: Models show an effort to push logic down the stack, but need more internal refactoring Below Expectations: Models are somewhat messy

1. ActiveRecord
Exceeds Expectations: Best choice ActiveRecord methods are used to solve each problem Meets Expectations: ActiveRecord is utilized wherever it can be. There is no Ruby where there should be ActiveRecord Below Expectations: Ruby is used to programmatically solve problems where ActiveRecord could be used

1. Testing
Exceeds Expectations: Project has a running test suite that covers all functionality, exercises the application at multiple levels, and covers edge cases Meets Expectations: Project has a running test suite that tests all functionality, at multiple levels Below Expectations: Project has sporadic use of tests

1. Usability
Exceeds Expectations: Project is highly usable and ready to deploy to customers Meets Expectations: Project is usable, but needs more polish or navigation before it'd be customer-ready Below Expectations: Project needs more attention to the User Experience, but works

1. Workflow
Exceeds Expectations: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, code review and a project management tool. Meets Expectations: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool. Below Expectations: Sporadic use of branches, pull requests, and/or project-management tool.
